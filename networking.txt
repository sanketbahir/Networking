ipv4 32 byts 4 bits frist bit tell as  about country, second bit tell us abouut 
state, third tell us about  isp , forth tell  us about the device
*type of network => 1) lan 2)man 3)van
*tyes of ip address 1) public 2) privet 3)static 4)dynamic

*types of protocol

*protocal =>  it means the set of rule
1)Tcp/ip => tcp and ip works together,tcp sends the data in small pack to the internet 

2)HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack

3)FTP => (File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol for transmitting files between computers over Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

4)SMTP =>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a TCP/IP protocol used in sending and receiving e-mail.  

5)POP => stands for Post Office Protocol Version 3. POP3 protocol is used to provide access to the mail inbox that is stored in the email server.

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is an email protocol used by email clients to retrieve emails from a mail server. It allows users to access their emails stored on the server, manage folders, and synchronize changes between the server and the client device.

7)ppp => 
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a TCP/IP protocol that is used to connect one computer system to another. Computers use PPP to communicate over the telephone network or the Internet
